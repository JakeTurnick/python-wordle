# Python World

Python Wordle is a recreation of the game Wordle that I made in python.

## How to play wordle

The player is given a 5 character length word that they must guess in under 6 attemps

Every correct letter guessed is marked in <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> if it is in the word but not in the right place or <span style="color:green">Green</span> if it is in the right place
